
You can use bayesian optimisation for any optimisation:

You just need to provide it with input parameters (in any measuring unit) and a score (in any measuring unit).
No programming knowledge is required. 

Check out: https://prod.brownie.projects.alexandra.dk. This is a guided user interface, 
which allows you to use bayesian optimisation without any coding experiece.

A fun thing to try is optimising the shooting length of this catapult 
https://sigmazone.com/catapult/

Try to hit 225 cm! 
As inputs give: “Pin elevation”, “Firing angle”, “Bungee position ” and “cup elevation.” 
Fire the catapult a report the score as cm away from 225 cm as a positive number. 

Download this file to easily configure the optimiser:

In an attempt to further Bayesian optimisation beyond pharma, the code has been made opensource and available in a python package 
check out https://github.com/novonordisk-research/ProcessOptimizer
